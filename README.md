This will be an app that collects data from individuals and generates statistics for SSB. 
It collects GPS and pulse from people. Individuals using the app will be able to 
see their own statistics and statistics over large cities in Norway. 


To be able to see the app and use what we've made so far find the mainController.java
class. The class is located in 05/tdt4140-gr1805/app.ui/src/main/java/app/ui.
Run as Java Application. 
Now a new window will open. Here you will get two options:

1) The first option is to click "Registrer Bruker". From here you can insert your birth
   day, choose gender and city. After doing that you can click "Registrer".

2) The second option is to insert a number and click on "Logg Inn". Now you have three 
  options. 
  
  Click on the statistics icon to open the statistics view. From here you can
  click on "See personal statistics" or "See city statistics" to view windows that 
  will show personal statistics or city statistics. 
    
  Click on the profile icon to open the user view. Here you can let the app know when 
  you’re going to bed, and when you’re waking up. 
  
  Click on the gear icon to open the settings view. Here you have a variety of options. 
  In the upper right, you can chose to delete your data, or delete your use altogether. 
  If you wish to opt out of the project, you can find the checkbox in the lower right 
  corner. Also, if you would like to temporarily pause gathering of either pulse data or 
  GPS, the options are there as well. 
  
  In all the different views, there’s an option in the upper left corner to go back 
  to the previous menu.
