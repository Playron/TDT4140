This will be an app that collects data from individuals and generates statistics for SSB. 
It collects GPS and pulse from people. Individuals using the app will be able to 
see their own statistics and statistics over large cities in Norway. 


To be able to see the app and use what we've made so far find the mainController.java
class. The class is located in 05/tdt4140-gr1805/app.ui/src/main/java/app/ui.
Run as Java Application. 
Now a new window will open. Here you will get two options:
1) The first option is to click "Registrer Bruker". From here you can insert your birth
   day, choose gender and city. After doing that you can click "Registrer".
2) The second option is to insert a number and click on "Logg Inn". Now you have three 
  options. 
  
  Click on the statistics icon to open the statistics view. From here you can
  click on "See personal statistics" or "See city statistics" to view windows that 
  will show personal statistics or city statistics.
